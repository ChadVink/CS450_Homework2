Hey Dr. Rivoire,

Our shell has a bug. The < redirect cannot be used in conjunction with other redirects
or pipes. We all spent a long time trying to fix this, but we were unable to fix our code.
It's odd, because we're doing nearly the same process as we do with the > redirect, which 
works with other pipes and redirects, but we cannot replicate this with <. The reason we
did not ask about it in class is because we figured with the extra 24 hours deadline, we
would be able to figure it out. However, after hours of tinkering, we are still unsuccessful
in this bug fix.

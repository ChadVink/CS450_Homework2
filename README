This makefile builds two executables:

- pipe_demo.x demonstrates how to fork two processes and connect them with a pipe.
  It is hard-coded to run the command "who | wc -l"

- pipes.x has a sample outer loop for the shell. It allows the user to enter input
  until they hit Ctrl-D, calls a helper function to split each input line into a list
  of words (that is, tokens separated by whitespace), and prints the list.
